## Note on sentence-final punctuation

Some sentences use the space-before style:

```
Vous avez soif ?
Laisse moi tranquille !
```

and some don't:

```
As-tu une voiture?
RÃ©veillez-vous!
```

There is no particular reason for why some sentences use one style and others use the other style, it's pretty random and arbitrary. The only rule is that *all* versions of a translation follow the same style.

Those that do have a normal space before the punctuation mark, that is, *not* a non-breaking space.
